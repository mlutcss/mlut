# My little UI toolkit
Responsive, simple and lightweight toolkit with progressive enhancement for website UI development. MLUT united in itself the [Atomic CSS](https://acss.io/) and [BEM](https://bem.info/) methodologies.

## Getting Started
There are 2 ways to start using MLUT:

- assembled dist
- developer toolkit

### Installation ###
#### Git ####
```
git clone https://MrZidan150@bitbucket.org/MrZidan150/mlut-lib.git
cd mlut-lib
```

#### NPM ####
```
npm install bitbucket:mrzidan150/mlut-lib
```

#### CDN ####
Comming soon.

### Usage ###
#### Dist ####
You can get assembled MLUT code and include it to your project. There are some ways to get a dist:

- if used `git clone` files are located in the `dist/` folder
- if used `npm` files are in `node_modules/mlut/dist/`

Then link file to your page:
``` html
<link href="css/mlut.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
```
And just add MLUT classes to markup:
``` html
<div class="row D-f">
	<div class="row__col W3gc_md">
		<h3>Simple text</h3>
```

#### Toolkit ####
To use all MLUT features you need an assembly. There are 3 ways:

- If you don't want to develop MLUT, it's recommended to use [MLUT project template](https://bitbucket.org/MrZidan150/mlut-project/)
- [Clone](#git) this repo and use configured assembly from it
- Setup assembly yourself use [technologies list](#technologies)

##### Styles #####
Once the assembly is configured, import sass tools and settings to your `style.scss`
``` scss
@import "includes/settings";
@import "includes/functions";
@import "includes/mixins";
```
Then you can import blocks, utilities and use sass tools:
```scss
@import "../core-blocks/wrapper/wrapper";
@import "../core-utils/display";

@include mlu-bpm($mlu-bp-md) {
	.input--common {
		padding: mlu-px2em(16px) 16;
	}
}
```
