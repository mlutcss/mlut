## Structure ##
- CSS library
- JS library (optional)
- Sass tools

### Library ###
The library part of toolkit united in itself ideas from [Atomic CSS](https://acss.io/) and [BEM](https://bem.info/). It consists of 2 layers:

- Core - all that can be used at any project. This layer contains BEM blocks, CSS utilities and simple optional scripts.
- Modules - themes, utilities sets and scripts, that can be reused in different projects.

In most projects, you will probably need to add another "design" layer that will be specific to your interface. It may contain any styles and scripts.

### Tools ###
Sass tools include:

- settings based on which the CSS library is generated.
- mixins and functions. Most of them are needed to generate the library, but can also be used for UI creating.

Most modules use existing MLUT Sass tools, but some may contain new ones or entirely consist of them.

## Getting Started ##

- assembled dist
- developer toolkit

### Usage ###

#### Distributive ####

You can get assembled MLUT code and include it to your project. There are some ways to get a distributive.

- just plug in with CDN
- if used `git clone`, files are located in the `dist/` folder

And just add MLUT classes to markup:
```html
<div class="row D-f">
	<div class="row__col W3c_md">
		<h3>Simple text</h3>
```

#### Toolkit ####
To use all MLUT features you need an assembly. There are 3 ways:

- Recommended to use [MLUT project template](https://github.com/mr150/mlut-project)
- [Clone](#git) this repo and use configured assembly from it
- Setup assembly yourself use [technologies list](https://mr150.github.io/mlut/)
